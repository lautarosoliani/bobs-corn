# Bob's Corn ðŸŒ½
# A PERN stack application with rate limiting and a client portal.

Overview
Bobâ€™s Corn is a full-stack application built using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express/NestJS, React, Node.js). It includes:

A rate limiter in the backend to restrict purchases to 1 corn per client per minute.
A frontend where clients can interactively purchase corn and track their progress.
Project Structure
The project is organized as a monorepo:

# Frontend built with Next.js and React Query
- **[Frontend README](https://github.com/lautarosoliani/bobs-corn/tree/main/frontend)**  
  Contains instructions to set up and run the frontend.

# Backend built with NestJS and Prisma
- **[Backend README](https://github.com/lautarosoliani/bobs-corn/tree/main/backend)**  
  Contains instructions to set up and run the backend.
  
# Application Behavior - Frontend
Clicking the "Buy Corn" button triggers a purchase request to the backend.
Successful purchase (200 OK):
The frontend updates the purchase count dynamically.
Rate limit exceeded (429 Too Many Requests):
An alert is displayed: "â›” Wait a minute before buying more corn!"
Other errors:
An alert is displayed: "ðŸ’¥ Server error, please try again later."

# Application Behavior - Backend
The /purchase endpoint implements rate limiting
If a purchase is made within the last minute returns 429 Too Many Requests.
If no recent purchase exists logs the new purchase and returns 200 OK.
How It Works
First Purchase:
The backend registers the purchase and responds with 200 OK.
The frontend increments the purchase count and displays the updated total.
Subsequent Purchases Within a Minute:
The backend enforces the rate limit and responds with 429 Too Many Requests.
The frontend displays an alert to wait before buying more corn.
After the Rate Limit Expires:
The backend allows a new purchase, responds with 200 OK, and the cycle repeats.
